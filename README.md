# WRSTBND Interview Project
## Version 1.1.2

This project stores the interview questions for potential WRSTBND hires. To run it, download the [latest version of Mendix Studio Pro](https://docs.mendix.com/howto/general/install/) and open InterviewQuestions.mpr.

In Mendix Studio Pro, in the App Explorer tab on the left-hand side, you will see a module called Start_Here. Inside that module is a page also called Start_Here.

Alternatively, press the green run triangle in the top right corner to start the project. Then click “View App” to open the same page in an internet browser.

Whichever method you choose, you will then see instructions on how to begin the project.
